I am a Master’s student in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech, currently contributing to research at the Brain-Inspired Computing and Communications (BRICC) Lab. My work focuses on digital design and hardware systems, with interests in computer architecture, verification, and neuromorphic computing.

I’ve been writing a **3-part blog series** on designing and testing a UART-based communication system on FPGA (Zynq ZC702 board). The series walks through **RTL design, simulation, and PS–PL integration using Vitis**, providing a complete workflow from theory to on-board validation.  

- [Post 1: Designing a UART based communication system](/posts/2025/09/uart-design-part1/)  
- [Post 2: Verification & On-board Testing of UART RTL](/posts/2025/09/uart-verification-testing/)  
- [Post 3: PS–PL Integration (Vitis Setup + Testing)](/posts/2025/09/uart-ps-pl-vitis/)  

Together, these posts explain **UART fundamentals, FSM-based TX/RX design, verification with testbenches, hardware loopback testing, and full PS–PL integration using Xilinx Vitis**. They’re meant as a practical guide for anyone interested in FPGA-based digital design and embedded system integration.
